Duckling Document Library (DDL)
===============================

V4.5.0
2022-03-17

DDL is kind of cloud storage service together with wiki. The new
version turns into personal usage and even embedded
environments. Nevertheless, the ability to scale up as cloud service
remains.

It works with UMT and CLB, and does not require VMT any more. When
launched by 'dklboot', there needs no configuration at all.

Currently, UI is in Chinese only.
