/**
 * Includes the content if an user check validates. This has been considerably
 * enhanced for 2.2. The possibilities for the "status"-argument are:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>"anonymous" - the body of the tag is included if the user is completely
 * unknown (no cookie, no password)</li>
 * <li>"asserted" - the body of the tag is included if the user has either been
 * named by a cookie, but not been authenticated.</li>
 * <li>"authenticated" - the body of the tag is included if the user is
 * validated either through the container, or by our own authentication.</li>
 * <li>"assertionsAllowed" - the body of the tag is included if wiki allows
 * identities to be asserted using cookies.</li>
 * <li>"assertionsNotAllowed" - the body of the tag is included if wiki does
 * <i>not</i> allow identities to be asserted using cookies.</li>
 * <li>"containerAuth" - the body of the tag is included if the user is
 * validated through the container.</li>
 * <li>"customAuth" - the body of the tag is included if the user is validated
 * through our own authentication.</li>
 * <li>"known" - if the user is not anonymous</li>
 * <li>"notAuthenticated" - the body of the tag is included if the user is not
 * yet authenticated.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * If the old "exists" -argument is used, it corresponds as follows:
 * <p>
 * <tt>exists="true" ==> status="known"<br>
 *  <tt>exists="false" ==> status="unknown"<br>
 *
 *  It is NOT a good idea to use BOTH of the arguments.
